# QuickCart---Real-Time-Grocery-Ordering-Platform
Phase 1 - Authentication, Product & Cart Management
04 Jul 2025 
Description
In this phase, interns will set up the complete project structure for both frontend and backend using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. They'll implement secure user authentication using JWT and establish role-based access for Admin and Customers. Interns will also build a dynamic product catalog with CRUD operations for Admin and a responsive product listing with cart functionality for Customers. Real-time cart updates using WebSockets and Redux Toolkit will be integrated to enhance user experience.
✅ Key Deliverables:
Project setup (React, TailwindCSS, Express, MongoDB Atlas)
JWT-based Sign Up/Login
Role-based routes (Admin, Customer)
Product model creation and API integration
Admin: Add/Edit/Delete products
Customer: View/Add to cart
Live cart updates via WebSockets
Redux setup for state management

Phase 2 - Orders, Payments & Deployment
04 Jul 2025 
Description:
This phase focuses on building a seamless order and payment workflow. Interns will develop order models, integrate Stripe API for secure payments, and enable Admins to manage order statuses. Interns will polish the UI by adding dark/light mode, error handling, and toast notifications. Finally, the project will be deployed with environment variable configuration, full documentation, and testing.
✅ Key Deliverables:
Order model creation & endpoints
Stripe API integration (checkout & receipt)
Admin panel to update order status
Dark/Light mode toggle with localStorage
UI enhancements: spinners, toasts, error handling
Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render/Railway (backend)
Final README & test case documentation
write the compete code and create the outline
